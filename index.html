            <h4>
                Dussehra, is a major Hindu festival celebrated in India and some other South Asian countries.
                 It is also known as Vijayadashami. The word "Dussehra" is derived from the Sanskrit words "Dasha" (meaning ten) and "Hara" 
                 (meaning defeat), symbolizing the victory of good over evil.
            </h4>
            <h1>
                Victory of Lord Ram:
            </h1>
            <h4>
                Dussehra commemorates the victory of the Hindu god Lord Ram over Ravana. According to the Hindu epic, the Ramayana, Ram's wife, 
                Sita, was kidnapped by Ravana, and after a long and arduous battle, Ram defeated Ravana and rescued Sita. Dussehra marks the day
                 when Ram killed Ravana, symbolizing the victory of good over evil.
            </h4>
            <h1>
                Goddess Durga:
            </h1>
            <h4>
                Dussehra also marks the end of the Navaratri festival, during which the goddess Durga is worshiped for nine days. On the tenth 
                day, known as Vijayadashami, idols of Goddess Durga are immersed in water, signifying her return to her divine abode.

            <h1>
                Ramlila
            </h1>
            <h4>
            The Ramayana is enacted through a series of dramatic performances called Ramlila during the ten days leading up to Dussehra. These
             performances depict the life and adventures of Lord Ram, culminating in the battle with Ravana and the destruction of his effigy.
